# divide_and_conquer_algorithm
My variation of the Karatsuba algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently multiply integers of arbitrary size. Instead of dividing the numbers into two digits as in the original algorithm, my variation divides each number into three digits. Then, multiplication is done recursively using these smaller digits.
